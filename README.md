Fork of https://github.com/ArthurConmy/Automatic-Circuit-Discovery by lseai.org

The main change is that 'icl' has been added to the tasks. 
Icl is in-context-learning, and it refers to Garg et al.'s model: https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01066
Weights are here provided in their 'tiny' configuration: 3 layers with 2 heads each.

The rest of the repository is unchanged. It is run with Poetry trough the acdc/main.py file.
